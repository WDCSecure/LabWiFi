## Compilation Instructions

To compile the report or clean the output directory, you can use the provided `compile.sh` script.

### First Time Setup

Before using the `compile.sh` script for the first time, make sure it has the necessary execute permissions. Run the following command to grant execute permissions to the script:

```bash
chmod +x compile.sh
```

### Compile Options

The `compile.sh` script provides the following functionalities:

- **Compile the main report**:
  ```bash
  ./compile.sh
  ```
  This compiles the `main.tex`, generating the PDF for the report in the `out` directory.

- **Clean the output directory**:
  ```bash
  ./compile.sh clean
  ```
  This removes all files in the `out` directory and any previously generated PDFs in the project root, ensuring a fresh build environment.

For any issues, please refer to the main project repository or contact the authors.

### Notes

- Ensure all necessary dependencies, including LaTeX and bibliography tools, are installed on your system before running the script.
- The output files are saved in the `out` directory, with the report and appendix PDFs copied to the project root with custom names.

This repository is structured for ease of integration and version control, with the report versioned separately from the main codebase. Happy compiling!
