\section{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES} \label{sec:background-and-objectives}

    This laboratory evaluates and compares the performance of wired and wireless communication in a local area network by setting up three scenarios: both devices on WiFi, both on Ethernet, and a mixed configuration with one on each.
    The main objectives of the lab are to:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Measure performances using iperf3 and Wireshark~\cite{iperf3, wireshark}.
        \item Analyze the variability and stability of the connection in each scenario by collecting data over multiple test runs.
        \item Compare the experimental results against theoretical predictions based on protocol efficiencies and network overhead.
        \item Investigate potential sources of performance degradation in wireless communication, such as interference, half-duplex operation, and shared medium limitations.
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent These experiments provide practical insights into the strengths and limitations of both Ethernet and WiFi, crucial for optimizing mixed network performance.
