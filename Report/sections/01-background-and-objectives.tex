\section{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES} \label{sec:background-and-objectives}

In this laboratory exercise, we aim to evaluate and compare the performance of wired and wireless communication within a local area network. The experiment involves setting up three distinct scenarios: both devices connected via WiFi, both devices connected via Ethernet, and a mixed configuration where one device uses Ethernet and the other uses WiFi. 

The main objectives of the lab are to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Measure the goodput, i.e., the rate of useful data received at the application layer, using iperf3.
    \item Analyze the variability and stability of the connection in each scenario by collecting data over multiple test runs.
    \item Compare the experimental results against theoretical predictions based on protocol efficiencies and network overhead.
    \item Investigate potential sources of performance degradation in wireless communication, such as interference, half-duplex operation, and shared medium limitations.
\end{itemize}

Through these experiments, we will gain practical insights into the strengths and limitations of both Ethernet and WiFi communication methods, which are crucial for optimizing network performance in mixed connectivity environments.
