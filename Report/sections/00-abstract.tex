    This report examines the performance of wireless and device-to-device communication by comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results in three scenarios: WiFi-only, Ethernet-only, and a mixed configuration. 
    Using iperf3 and Wireshark, we measured goodput and analyzed its variability under different conditions. 
    The experimental data were contrasted with theoretical estimates based on protocol efficiencies and network overheads. 
    Our findings underscore Ethernet's stability and highlight the challenges of WiFi's shared medium and half-duplex constraints.
