    This report investigates the performance of wireless and device-to-device communication by comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results in three distinct scenarios: both devices connected via WiFi, both via Ethernet, and a mixed configuration where one device uses Ethernet and the other WiFi. Using tools such as iperf3 and Wireshark, we measured the goodput and analyzed its variability under different network conditions. The experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations based on protocol efficiencies and network overheads. Our findings highlight the stability of Ethernet connections and the challenges posed by WiFi's shared medium and half-duplex constraints. This study provides useful insights for optimizing network configurations in mixed environments.
